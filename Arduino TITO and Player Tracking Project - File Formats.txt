PLAYER AND CONFIG FILE FORMATS

The config file is a standard .TXT file in a ‘property=value’ format. A default file is included in the download. Property names are CASE SENSITIVE. It has the following properties:

displayWidth=20 	<- The width of your display (columns or pixels - depending on display)
displayHeight=2		<- The height of your character display (rows or pixels - depending on display)
displayCols=20  	<- Used to set number of characters per row (for pixel displays; otherwise set to match displayWidth)
displayRows=2  		<- Used to set number of character rows (for pixel displays; otherwise set to match displayHeight)
scrollDelay=110 	<- The scroll delay, in ms
logToSerial=1 		<- Set to 1 to log output to the serial device, 0 to prevent logging
localStorage=1  	<- Set to 1 to store data to the local SD card; Set to 0 to when data is stored on another device
onlyTITO=0  		<- Set to 1 to disable player tracking and display features; Set to 0 to enable all features
changeToCredits=0  	<- Set to 1 to enable pressing the Change/Service button to add credits to machine; Set to 0 to disable 
changeCredits=200  	<- Number of credits to add to machine when changeToCredits option is enabled
adminPin=1234  		<- Used to secure admin mode
compPercentage=0.01  	<- Used to determine comp payback; Set to zero to disable comps
wifiSSID= 		<- Used in the Wifi/ESP8266 compatible sketch only
wifiPassword= 		<- Used in the Wifi/ESP8266 compatible sketch only
useDHCP=1  		<- Set to 1 to use DHCP to get IP Address from network; Set to 0 to manually enter an IP Address
ipAddress=  		<- Manual IP Address if useDHCP is set to 0
serverIPAddress=  	<- IP Address of server/machine hosting the card data; Do not set this to be itself
autoAddCredits=0        <- MEGA ONLY - Set to 1 to automatically add the number of credits in 'changeCredits' to the game when the creditFloor value is reached
creditFloor=10          <- MEGA ONLY - Set to a number greater than 0 at which point you want the game to automatically add credits if autoAddCredits is enabled
gameName=Slot Machine  	<- A name for your machine
casinoName=The CASINO  	<- The name of your casino which will appear on the display
attractMessage=Welcome to the [CASINONAME]! Enjoy your stay! Please insert your Player Card     <- The attract message text
playerMessage=Welcome back [CARDHOLDER]! Enjoy your stay in [CASINONAME]!   			<- Message when player card is inserted

[CARDHOLDER] is a variable you can use in the playerMessage to show the Cardholder’s name. Messages cannot exceed 255 characters.
[CASINONAME] is a variable you can use in the scrollingText or playerMessage to show the Casino Name.

Scrolling messages have a length of 255 characters; Text fields have a length of 30 characters - except for the casinoName field which has a max length equal to the display width or 30 characters - whichever is less. All other fields are boolean or integer.


The player file is a standard .TXT file in a ‘property=value’ format. Property names are CASE SENSITIVE. The filename is based on the RFID Card ID, example: DA939819.TXT. On first use new cards automatically create a default file on the SD card (or server) with the following properties:

cardHolder=Player
cardType=1
playerTotalGames=0
playerGamesWon=0
playerGamesLost=0
playerTotalWon=0
playerComps=0


The cardHolder field can be customized with any name up to 30 characters. The CardType property must be a 1. The other properties will be updated automatically during game play.

The Admin card is a standard .TXT file in a ‘property=value’ format. Property names are CASE SENSITIVE. The filename is based on the RFID Card ID. A player card can be converted into an Admin card by replacing the file contents with these properties:

carHholder=Admin
cardType=2

The CardType property must be a 2.


The System Bonus card is a standard .TXT file in a ‘property=value’ format. Property names are CASE SENSITIVE. The filename is based on the RFID Card ID. A player card can be converted into a System Bonus card by replacing the file contents with these properties:

cardHolder=SYSTEM BONUS
cardType=3
creditsToAdd=1000

The CardType property must be a 3. You can set the creditsToAdd property to be any number up to your max credits amount on the machine.
